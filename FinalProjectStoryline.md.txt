Ultimate Survival
choose your destiny
Introduction: It’s your first day off your new job and you decide you want to start your day off with a nice hike on the trails. You notice that every tree looks the same and you feel lost. You start to panic. You do not have any supplies with you, just a bottle of water.


Start: You see a trail. Do you want to stay on the path or take the trail?


S1: (Stay on the path) You’re walking along and start getting really hungry, while you’re walking you see some berries. Do you want to a) eat them or b) keep walking even though you’re really hungry? Type “a” or “b” 


S1.1: (Decided to not eat the berries) So you keep walking, now you hear a rustle in the bush.. Do you want to a) investigate or b) to run away? 


S1.1.1:  (you decide to not go investigate) You only have a little bit of water left. Do you want to a) drink it now or b) save it for later?


S1.1.1.2: (You decide not to drink water) You are now feeling fuzzy and pass out on the dirt from dehydration. An animal comes and gets you and you’re now dead.


S1.1.1.1:(You drink the water) You drink the water and keep hiking up the trail. A nearby park ranger finds you and leads you to the trail’s exit. Great job, you survived!


S1.1.2: (Investigate) You find an animal that looks injured. Do you a) help or b) leave the poor animal there suffering? :( 


S1.1.2.1:  (Decide to run)You run away and you come across a group of people that were hiking there too so they save you. 


S.1.1.2.2: You investigated the animal hidden in the bushes, only to find out that it was playing dead! Unfortunately, it is a predator and it attacks you! You bleed to death.


S1.2: You eat the berries! Your stomach starts to feel funny, and you are a little skeptical. You decide to ignore the funny feeling and continue on the path. 






S2: You take the trail and fall into a hole that was covered by a bunch of bushes and get an injury. Do you want to a) stay and wait for help or b) keep going?


S2.1: While you wait, you see a branch full of berries that fell with you. Do you a) eat the berries, or b) tough it up and crawl out of the hole?


S2.2:  You get about halfway down the trail and realize nature is calling. You look around and all you see is a bush. Do you want to a) relieve yourself by the bush or b) keep going?


S2.2.1: You decide to go, but you quickly realized that the bush was poison ivy! As you keep walking along, and you see a beehive. Maybe some honey will help with the unbearable itching. Do you a) grab some honey or b) keep walking?


S2.2.2: (Not go to the bathroom) You continue on the path. The sun is going down and you think it would be a good idea to start a fire. Do use a) pine cones or b) pine needles?


S2.2.1.1: The hive is hanging in a tree. You see a branch lying on the ground. You grab it and poke at the hive to knock it down. The angry bees come out and attack you. You are now dead.


S2.2.1.2: You decided to continue on the trail. You turn the corner and you see a little office with a park ranger in it. You walk over and the ranger cares for your wound and takes you home. You’re saved!


S2.2.2.1: The fumes from the pine cones ignite a nearby tree, which sets off a massive forest fire! You are now dead!


S2.2.2.2: Your fire is safe and contained with the pine needles, so you stay warm. Fortunately, people saw the smoke and came to find you. You're saved!




S3: Do you want a)to continue to eat the berries or b) keep going on the trail?


S3.1: (it sends you to scenario 2.2) 


S3.2: The berries were poisonous! You didn’t realize this, and now you’re dead. Better luck next time. 




S4: While you wait you see some berries to the left of you. Do you a)eat them or b) keep going?


S4.1: (No)


S4.2: (Yes) DEATH. The berries were poisonous.
